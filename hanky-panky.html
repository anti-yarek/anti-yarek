        <p>Hanky-Panky is a thought-up conference about oversexualization of female anime characters. I created all of the tiny details, such as the main theme for the 2022 conference, location, speakers and topics they will be discussing, etc.</p>
        <p>The main purpose, though, was not to make a fantasy world, but create a fitting visual language for it through a tedious research and development process.</p>
        <p>As the main theme of this yearâ€™s conference is the anime called Kill la Kill, a lot of visual elements were taken from it to form the design. The Raglan-Punch typeface, which is always stretched to fit the frame in the series, and the main contrasting colors, signifying the opposition of two sides.</p>

        <p>Kill la Kill is an anime, which was supposed to be something sexually empowering, but the camerawork and female character design made it to be the opposite in the eyes of the masses. There are many opinions about this topic, and the 2022 Hanky-Panky is supposed to be an event, dedicated to presenting these opinions to the wider audience and letting the western creators and critics have a chance to state their position, as well as, listen to what the authors of Kill la Kill and other representatives of Japanese culture have to say.</p>
        <p>To sum it up, the visual language of Hanky-Panky is built upon the red and blue color scheme, stretched out Raglan-Punch typeface, the use of English and traditional Japanese typesetting, and the layout, which creates a contrast between the two halves.</p>
        <p>The first poster is an announcement of the conference. Its imagery was made, through layering two pictures, containing all characters: dressed and naked, on top of each other. It shows how the purposeful hyper-sexualisation, initiated for the sake of being sarcastic and critical of regular, unnecessary over-sexualisation in anime, should evoke a positive reaction, just like an anime without sexuality at all.</p>
        <p>The same two images are used in the second one, though, in contrasting positions to one another, instead of layering. I developped this layout, while holding onto the idea of contrasting views on oversexualisation being posed against one another. This works best for the schedule poster, as it presents the speakers and the topics of their talks. The overall choice of colors is also something, that presents the same idea throughout this visual language.</p>
        <p>The process of creating the visual language involved a lot of research. For the Japanese content I used vertical typesetting, traditional to manga, while the English half is set horizontally, left to right. For the sake of doing that, I had to learn how to do this right, both in terms of treating the content and using the Japanese typesetting functionality in Indesign. I also conducted research on the use of frames in Japanese poster, which makes the placement of content more engaging and readable.</p>
